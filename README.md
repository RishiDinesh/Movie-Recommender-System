# Movie-Recommender-System

This repository contains the datasets and code required for the Winter Sem DBMS J component (2019-20). The code builds a basic hybrid movie recommender system using the dataset mined using the OMDb API and the MovieLens ratings dataset. The code integrates the previously well known content-based filter and collaborative filter to construct a content boosted collaborative filter.
